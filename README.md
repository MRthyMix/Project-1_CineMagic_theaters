# Final Project AI IMAX CineMagic Theater at GTCC

The CineMagic Theater project is a command-line C++ application designed to simulate the experience of visiting a movie theater. Users can purchase tickets, select from a variety of snacks and beverages, and even choose their desired seats. The program utilizes data structures, arrays, and switch statements to ensure effective organization and management of user interactions. It operates entirely within the command prompt or a similar environment, offering a user-friendly and practical way to simulate a trip to the movies.
